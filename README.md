## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt creating that for creating a responsive website one can make the main div flexbox as is done here and then use *justify-content* and *align-items* to center the div for every screen size.

```css
.container{
  background-color: transparent; 
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  display: flex;
  height: 97vh;
  }
```
